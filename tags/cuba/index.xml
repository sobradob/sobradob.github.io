She walks under the strong Cuban sun and visits the food market . She&amp;rsquo;s lucky: they have eggs today.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;How much for the box?&amp;rdquo; she asks, pointing at the box of 30 eggs.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Four pesos&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>She looks in her purse and finds a 100 peso note. She hands the note to the seller, who nods and hands her the eggs. She leaves without getting any change, nor did she expect to.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cuba’s short term property rental market 2017-2018</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2018/08/11/cubas-short-term-property-rental-market-2017-2018/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Aug 2018 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2018/08/11/cubas-short-term-property-rental-market-2017-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>In July of 2017 President Trump announced with much fanfare a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42345919/what-s-changed-in-us-cuba-relations-under-trump">new policy towards Cuba&lt;/a>. This was following the Obama administrations &amp;ldquo;thaw&amp;rdquo; in Cuban-American bilateral relations, which had lead to a noticable rise in Americas visiting the island. Then more bad news for the Cuban tourism industry:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_syndrome">sonic warfare in the news&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/2019/01/29/05/49/cuba-hurricane-three-dead-eastern-havana">hurricanes&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All of this together had a noticable impact on the Cuban tourism sector. &lt;a href="http://www.escambray.cu/2018/cuba-mira-con-fuerza-a-los-cinco-millones-de-visitantes-extranjeros-en-2019/">Official Cuban statistics&lt;/a> show that tourism numbers are going up. This year there were a record number of visits. However, the truth is much more nuanced. Tourists &lt;em>flying&lt;/em> in to Cuba actually decreased by 6 percent. There was a strong rise in cruise ship passengers (48%), however the methodology of counting each disembarcation of a passenger as an extra visit might inflate tourism numbers. Moreover, cruise ship passengers spend less, particularly on acccommodation (they sleep on the boat).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alphabetically inspired anecdotes from Cuba: 58 years after 1958</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/06/12/alphabetically-inspired-anecdotes-from-cuba-58-years-after-1958/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 11:32:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/06/12/alphabetically-inspired-anecdotes-from-cuba-58-years-after-1958/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="aviacion-de-cubana">Aviacion de Cubana&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There was no toilet paper on the Russian-made Antonov 158 plane which took me and 15 other passengers to Havana. The Cuban state airline, Cubana de Aviacion, clearly does not need have to meet profitability targets. Even the dry sandwich they served tasted of an iron curtain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not unlike the other living political museum of China, immigration and customs is relatively straightforward. If you had to guess the political system of a country based on the border control procedures you’d probably guess the United States is authoritarian.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
