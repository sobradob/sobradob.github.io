&lt;p>However, given that cigarettes are also an appetite suppressant, I have always wondered what the chart would look like if we include obesity rates. Obesity started becoming a problem more or less when cigarette sales started to drop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t to imply that one directly caused the other, but it does warrant some investigation. Anyway, I decided to replicate the famous chart and include obesity rates in it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
