Dr. King replied, &ldquo;I judge people by their own principles - not by my own.&rdquo;</p><p>J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.</p><p>a hundred years before Christ was born a famous old Roman poet, Publilius Syrus, remarked; &ldquo;We are interested in others when they are interested in us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Talk to people about themselves,&rdquo; said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire. &ldquo;Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours .&rdquo;</p><h4 id=the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-benjamin-franklin>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (Benjamin Franklin)</h4><p>Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves.</p><p>This flattered my vanity; but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling me verse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most probably a very bad one; but as prose writing had been of great use to me in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my advancement.</p><p>[On getting into arguments] Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom fall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts that have been bred at Edinborough.</p><p>Men should be taught as if you taught them not, And things unknown propos&rsquo;d as things forgot.</p><p>A man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro&rsquo; fear of being thought to have but little. &ldquo;He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.&rdquo;</p><p>In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman, I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary.</p><h4 id=theodore-roosevelt-an-autobiography-roosevelt-theodore>Theodore Roosevelt; an Autobiography (Roosevelt, Theodore)</h4><p>I thoroughly enjoyed Harvard, and I am sure it did me good, but only in the general effect, for there was very little in my actual studies which helped me in after life.</p><p>He says that at the outset almost every man is frightened when he goes into action, but that the course to follow is for the man to keep such a grip on himself that he can act just as if he was not frightened. After this is kept up long enough it changes from pretense to reality, and the man does in very fact become fearless by sheer dint of practicing fearlessness when he does not feel it.</p><p>I did not then believe, and I do not now believe, that any man should ever attempt to make politics his only career. It is a dreadful misfortune for a man to grow to feel that his whole livelihood and whole happiness depend upon his staying in office. Such a feeling prevents him from being of real service to the people while in office, and always puts him under the heaviest strain of pressure to barter his convictions for the sake of holding office.</p><p>I went around there often enough to have the men get accustomed to me and to have me get accustomed to them, so that we began to speak the same language, and so that each could begin to live down in the other&rsquo;s mind what Bret Harte has called &ldquo;the defective moral quality of being a stranger.&rdquo;</p><p>It is not often that a man can make opportunities for himself. But he can put himself in such shape that when or if the opportunities come he is ready to take advantage of them.</p><p>No one of us cares permanently to have some one else conscientiously striving to do him good; what we want is to work with that some one else for the good of both of us</p><p>Any man who has met with success, if he will be frank with himself, must admit that there has been a big element of fortune in the success.</p><p>Let him remember, by the way, that the unforgivable crime is soft hitting. Do not hit at all if it can be avoided; but never hit softly.</p><p>We made no promise which we could not and did not keep. We made no threat which we did not carry out.</p><p>Nine-tenths of wisdom is to be wise in time, and at the right time;</p><h3 id=january>January</h3><h4 id=sam-walton-made-in-america-sam-walton>Sam Walton Made in America (Sam Walton)</h4><p>I learned a long time ago that exercising your ego in public is definitely not the way to build an effective organization.</p><p>It never occurred to me that I might lose; to me, it was almost as if I had a right to win. Thinking like that often seems to turn into sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>Now I realize the simple truth: I got into retailing because I was tired and I wanted a real job.</p><p>Another way we tried hard to make up for our lack of experience and sophistication was to spend as much time as we could checking out the competition.</p><h4 id=andrew-carnegie-david-nasaw>Andrew Carnegie (David Nasaw)</h4><p>With a talent for cloaking self-interest in larger humanitarian concerns, he made a premature case for free public libraries.</p><p>Carnegie had all his life found a way to attach himself to older people who could be of use to him—and he to them.</p><p>To raise money for roads not yet built and probably not really needed, Carnegie and Scott trafficked in what Richard White refers to as “the utilitarian fictions of capitalism.”</p><p>WHEN A.B. FARQUHAR, a Pennsylvania businessman, mentioned to Carnegie that he was always sure to be in his office by “seven in the morning,” Carnegie remarked laughingly: “‘You must be a lazy man if it takes you ten hours to do a day’s work.’</p><h4 id=the-picture-of-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde>The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde)</h4><p>The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.</p><p>It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.</p><p>&ldquo;Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a fuss people make about fidelity!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Henry. &ldquo;Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, Uncle George, I&rsquo;ll tell her, but it won&rsquo;t have any effect. Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their distinguishing characteristic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,&rdquo; he said after a few puffs. &ldquo;Why, Harry?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because they are so sentimental.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I like sentimental people.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.&rdquo;</p><p>When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one&rsquo;s self, and one always ends by deceiving others.</p><p>Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives."</p><p>one of those middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by their friends;</p><p>&ldquo;What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Henry. &ldquo;A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=february>February</h3><h4 id=war-and-peace-graf-leo-tolstoy>War and Peace (graf Leo Tolstoy)</h4><p>He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid.</p><p>Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.</p><p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me for exercising an old woman&rsquo;s privilege.&rdquo; She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have mentioned their age.</p><p>She was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity, and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty.</p><p>Helene Bezukhova&rsquo;s reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception.</p><p>Anatole, with the partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to Dolokhov a hundred times.</p><p>The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakcheev belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say.</p><p>Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract notion—science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The German&rsquo;s self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth—science—which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth.</p><p>Not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes—love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their &lsquo;genius&rsquo; was invented for them long ago because they have power!</p><p>The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been won.</p><p>And as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones,</p><h4 id=losing-my-virginity-how-i-survived-had-fun-and-made-a-fortune-doing-business-my-way-richard-branson>Losing My Virginity: How I Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way (Richard Branson)</h4><p>Granny was 99 when she died. Shortly before that, she had written to me to say that the previous ten years had been the best of her life.</p><p>As he walked out of the meeting, he turned to one of his companions and made a comment which was picked up on the intercom and broadcast all over the office. He said, ‘I’ll be in my grave before that fucker gets his logo on my trains.’</p><h4 id=the-history-of-the-peloponnesian-war-thucydides>The History of the Peloponnesian War (Thucydides)</h4><p>Men&rsquo;s indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior.</p><p>I am more afraid of our own blunders than of the enemy&rsquo;s devices.</p><p>Zeal is always at its height at the commencement of an undertaking</p><p>The truth is that great good fortune coming suddenly and unexpectedly tends to make a people insolent;</p><p>In this contest the blunter wits were most successful.</p><h3 id=may>May</h3><h4 id=collected-essays-orwell-george-1903-1950>Collected Essays (Orwell, George, 1903-1950)</h4><p>It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide.</p><p>Doubtless any horoscope seems ‘true’ if it tells you that you are highly attractive to the opposite sex and your worst fault is generosity.</p><p>In Moulmein, in lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people — the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me.</p><p>But traditions are not killed by facts, and the tradition of Northern’ grit’ lingers.</p><p>Gazelles are almost the only animals that look good to eat when they are still alive, in fact, one can hardly look at their hindquarters without thinking of mint sauce.</p><p>Personally I believe that most people are influenced far more than they would care to admit by novels, serial stories, films and so forth, and that from this point of view the worst books are often the most important, because they are usually the ones that are read earliest in life.</p><p>All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.</p><p>There are people who are convinced of the wickedness both of armies and of police forces, but who are nevertheless much more intolerant and inquisitorial in outlook than the normal person who believes that it is necessary to use violence in certain circumstances. They will not say to somebody else, “Do this, that and the other or you will go to prison”, but they will, if they can, get inside his brain and dictate his thoughts for him in the minutest particulars.</p><h4 id=journey-to-the-west-wu-cheng-en>Journey to the West (Wu Cheng-en)</h4><p>‘The magistrate may be wrong and the sergeant may be wrong, but the man who comes to get you is never wrong.’</p><p>A hundred years flow by like water; A lifetime’s career is no more than a bubble, The face that yesterday was the color of peach-blossom Today is edged with snow. When the white ants’ line of battle collapses, all is illusion; “Repent, repent,” is the cuckoo’s urgent call.
