Last year [I wrote about](https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2024/04/01/decentralised-bitcoin-trading-platform-bisq-has-hit-record-highs/) BISQ hitting record highs. Those records have since been smashed. Q2 2024 saw over 60 million dollars in volume, and 2025 sustained those levels throughout the year.

The XMR/BTC pair continues to dominate. As Monero got [delisted from centralised exchanges](https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2025/02/20/monerotalk-podcast-keeping-bitcoins-cypherpunk-dream-alive/), traders moved to the one venue that couldn't be shut down.

Fiat volumes are also at all-time highs, with BRL now rivalling EUR as a top currency pair.

The payment method breakdown tells the same story. PIX, Brazil's instant payment system, has become one of BISQ's dominant fiat rails.

The cypherpunk dream hasn't died - it's migrated. While Bitcoin became Wall Street's digital gold, demand for private, censorship-resistant finance found its home on platforms like BISQ.
