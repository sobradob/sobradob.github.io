*Co-written with Claude*

In August 2019, Revolut froze my accounts (both personal and business) without warning. What followed was a year-long saga involving hundreds of documents, automated customer service responses with the same typo, false information from support agents, and eventually a county court claim that Revolut settled. I've never written about it publicly before. Now that Revolut has a UK banking license and a $45 billion valuation, it seems like a good time.

## The Background

During the Obama administration's push to normalise relations with Cuba, a wave of American tech companies entered the island for the first time. Airbnb launched there in 2015. Booking.com followed. Suddenly, Cuban private sector businesses (the cuentapropistas) had access to global tourism platforms. I saw an opportunity and started a small Estonian-registered digital marketing company that helped licensed Cuban tourism businesses sell their services online. Property managers, hostel owners, transportation providers: the kind of small operators that the Obama-era reforms were designed to support.

We managed company funds through Revolut's business account. It was convenient for international payments and cheap. Exactly what Revolut markets itself as.

On August 20th, 2019, while I was travelling, Revolut froze both my personal account and my company's business account. No explanation. No warning. Just frozen.

## The Misinformation

On the same day (August 20th), I asked customer service what would happen with the roughly €3,000 in incoming payments heading to my business account. A representative named Vicky told me at 16:49:

> "As for this account, it is still under the review, funds which were sent to this account would bounce back to the sender."

I relied on this. I informed my payment processor and my business partners to watch for bouncing transactions and reroute them to a different bank account.

The transactions never bounced. Over the following days, money kept flowing into the frozen account where I couldn't touch it: €80 on August 21st, €267 on August 22nd, €1,899 on August 23rd, and €50 on September 18th. These were payments from Booking.com and other payment processors, money my business had earned. On August 28th, a different customer service agent named Otto contradicted Vicky and confirmed that yes, you can still receive incoming payments to a frozen account.

By then the damage was done. More than €2,000 was locked up alongside the rest of my funds. Had Revolut told me the truth on day one, I could have redirected every one of those payments. Instead, Revolut held my money and presumably earned interest on it.

## The Documentation Black Hole

Revolut then asked me to submit documents to verify my account. I complied fully. Over the course of a few weeks in late August and early September 2019, I submitted approximately 300 documents: account statements, business contracts, invoices, passport photos, corporate articles of association, screenshots of counterparties. Everything they asked for.

Revolut stopped asking for new documents on September 6th, 2019. And then... nothing. For months.

## The Autoresponse Wall

From October 11th, 2019 onwards, every single message I sent to Revolut was met with the same canned response:

> "Dear Customer, We can see your account has been temporarily locked. We understand this is causing inconvenience and are doing our best to fix this as soon as possible. This is a security review whereby we simply need to check a few things about your account. Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with a specific time frame, but rest assured thatwe are doing our best to finish this as quickly as we can."

Note the "thatwe" typo. It appeared in every single response, confirming these were automated. I asked to close my account. Same response. I asked for an account statement. Same response. I told them I was filing a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman. Same response. I told them I was in financial hardship. Same response.

I couldn't even find out which subscriptions were charging my frozen card or who was still paying into my Revolut account. Basic account statements, something Revolut was legally required to provide under the FCA's Banking Code of Business Sourcebook, were simply refused.

## The Business Damage

With my cash flow interrupted for months, I couldn't pay my business partners in Cuba on time. The delays directly caused the loss of eight property management clients, all of whom cited late payments as their reason for leaving. These were small businesses for whom timely payment was everything. For a company like mine, that represented a meaningful chunk of annual revenue.

## Taking Revolut to Court

On January 20th, 2020 (five months after the freeze), I sent a formal pre-action letter to Revolut's legal department at 107 Cheapside, London. It laid out my claims: debt, unjust enrichment, breach of the FCA's Banking Code, and breach of contract. I gave them 14 days to respond. They ignored it.

I filed a claim in the County Court at Central London. The claims were straightforward: Revolut owed me the money in my accounts and was refusing to release it; they'd given me false information that caused them to intercept funds I would have otherwise received; they'd refused to provide legally required account statements; and the frozen accounts had caused real, quantifiable business losses.

Then, on February 20th, 2020, Revolut decided to deactivate my business account entirely and claimed to have sent all remaining funds back to the original senders, six months after freezing my account, without my consent, and while a court claim was pending. On February 24th I wrote to Revolut pointing out that sending my money to entities that had paid me over six months ago was not an acceptable resolution.

## The Settlement

Revolut's legal team finally engaged on July 7th, 2020, nearly eleven months after freezing my accounts. Their first settlement offer was £500. Five hundred pounds. My business account alone held approximately €3,629. They were offering me roughly 14% of my own money and calling it a settlement.

I replied the next day, on July 8th. My letter was blunt: "Your response is regrettable and disappointing. I do not accept your offer." In their own defence filed on March 16th, Revolut had admitted the account balance was at least €3,629. The money was mine. I demanded the full balance, plus the £185 in court fees I'd already paid, plus the £500 they'd offered (a total of approximately €4,391) along with an up-to-date account statement, which they still hadn't provided.

Three weeks later, on July 27th, Revolut came back with a revised offer: £3,445, the account balance plus court fees. Alongside it, they finally sent the transaction statement for the business account. It had taken Revolut nearly a year to fulfill its legal obligation to provide a customer with an account statement.

But the offer came with a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause: I would get my money back, but only if I agreed never to talk about what happened. There was no reason I should make "further contractual concessions simply to recover the amount standing to [my] credit in [my] account." This is why you rarely hear about these cases. Most people who settle sign the NDA, take their money, and stay silent. The company's reputation stays intact.

I also flagged what I considered a trap: on July 28th, Revolut asked me to withdraw the court claim before I'd even seen the settlement agreement's terms, let alone received any money. For a company dealing with a self-represented individual, that felt especially sharp-elbowed. On July 29th I accepted the payment amount but explicitly rejected the agreement, calling out the trap: if I had withdrawn the claim first, I would have been beholden to accept whatever terms they dictated. On July 30th I reiterated my position and warned that I would soon be instructing counsel, and that any future settlement would necessarily require payment of legal costs.

On August 4th, Revolut sent a revised settlement offer without the objectionable terms. I signed it (exclusively in my capacity as company director) and on August 12th I received the main transfer and withdrew the court claim.

But even then it wasn't over. There was still approximately €30 missing from my personal account, funds Revolut had sent "back to source" to a bank account that had since been closed. What followed was another month of delays. Revolut's external counsel cited issues with the recipient bank, sent "a number of further chasers," and provided weekly updates that amounted to: still waiting. On September 4th they apologised and offered to pay the GBP equivalent of €30 as a "gesture of goodwill." On September 15th, 2020 (392 days after the initial freeze) the final payment was confirmed. I never signed their settlement agreement or its confidentiality clause. Which is why I can write this.

## I Was Not Alone

My case was not unusual. In fact, it was part of a much larger pattern that became a genuine scandal across Europe in 2019-2020.

In July 2018, The Telegraph revealed that Revolut had switched off its automated money laundering surveillance system for three months, allowing potentially suspicious transactions to pass through undetected. The resulting compliance crackdown was severe and indiscriminate. Revolut's CFO Peter O'Higgins resigned in early 2019. The Financial Ombudsman received 985 new Revolut complaints in the second half of 2020 alone, and Resolver tracked 3,911 total complaints against Revolut in 2020, a 57% increase from the previous year. The story made headlines across Europe, including in Hungary, where I was living at the time.

The cases that made the news were often worse than mine. The Times reported that Revolut froze a €300,000 business account belonging to a French energy transition startup that helped low-income families insulate their homes. The company couldn't pay its staff. The Telegraph covered an investment manager whose £90,000 was locked for months, and another customer who travelled 500 miles from rural France to Revolut's London office to try to recover £15,000 in person. He was unsuccessful.

The pattern was always the same: account frozen, documents requested, documents submitted, silence. The customer service wall of automated responses is not an accident; it's a design choice. When the cost of resolving a complaint exceeds the balance in the account, most people give up. That's the point.

What made my case different is that I didn't give up. I filed in small claims court, which, by the way, cost me £185 and required no solicitor. The entire process is designed for individuals. You can file online through Money Claims Online. The moment Revolut's legal department had to engage with a real court proceeding, the dynamics changed entirely. Suddenly there were named people on the other end of the email chain, actual letters, and a transaction statement that took nearly a year to produce.

The FCA requires e-money institutions to provide account statements. Revolut simply didn't, for months, and faced no apparent consequences from the regulator. The court system was the only mechanism that actually worked.

## Why I'm Writing This Now

Revolut now has a UK banking license and is valued at $45 billion. It processes billions in transactions and serves millions of customers. It's a legitimate, important financial institution. But the structural incentives that led to my experience (where it was cheaper to stonewall a customer than to resolve their complaint) haven't fundamentally changed across the neobank sector.

The interesting thing about my case is how small it was. We're talking about a few thousand euros. Revolut's opening offer was £500, a fraction of what they owed, and it still took months of back-and-forth, a revised offer, a rejected settlement agreement, and multiple payment delays before I got my money back. Between external counsel, in-house lawyers, and the payments team, Revolut almost certainly spent more on legal fees engaging with my claim than the account balance was worth. The economics only make sense if you assume that 99% of people in my situation will give up. And they're probably right about that.

If your neobank account gets frozen, here's what I'd tell you: screenshot everything from day one. Keep every chat log, every automated response, every typo. File a formal complaint. If they ignore it, file in small claims court. The process is designed to be accessible, and the filing fee is recoverable if you win. Don't accept silence as an answer.
