## Introduction

Commercially aware, data savvy and tech literate. Professionally focused on growth strategy & analytics for FinTech companies. Digital marketing experience since 2015, when I researched psychometric digital advertising and helped unearth the [Cambridge Analytica](/blog/2020/12/11/my-thoughts-on-cambridge-analytica/) scandal. Passionate about using the internet to bring opportunities to those who need them most.

Have written & spoken about topics ranging from cross-border transfers, the efficacy of the current KYC/AML regime, web3 gaming & the "Metaverse", decentralised finance, futures & automated market makers, the use of cryptocurrencies in authoritarian nations and the difficulties of measuring Bitcoin markets.
