&lt;p>When I arrived at Cambridge in 2011 I was immediately approached by hordes of corporates trying to sell me (a clueless teenager) a vision of what I should do after university. Law firms, investment banks and consultancies spend a large amount of money getting clueless students to go to career events. All you have to do is listen a bit to what it is they do and you&amp;rsquo;ll get some booze and food in exchange. You go there and listen to some strange corporate mumbojumbo, a secular equivalent of sitting at Latin Mass. You should join our company because it is different from other companies. In the same way the United Methodist Church is clearly different to the Free Methodist Church. The HR person is followed up by someone that clearly has more important things to do, but is evangelising to boozed up teenagers out of a sense of duty. They are here to sell a vision, a structure of reality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thirteen hours in Rotterdam</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2017/01/11/thirteen-hours-in-rotterdam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 11:32:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2017/01/11/thirteen-hours-in-rotterdam/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oscar Wilde once wrote:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I bought a bus ticket from London to Rotterdam. I did this in order to save what effectively amounts to the price of a handful of beers in London prices. I needed to get to Budapest, and I already had a flight leaving from Rotterdam booked. I spent 8 excruciating hours on a bus from London Victoria to Rotterdam Centraal, to in Rotterdam at 5 am in a cold winter morning. My flight to Budapest left 13 hours later. Thoroughly stupid.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Donald Trump and Zuckerberg's Matrix</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/02/29/donald-trump-and-zuckerbergs-matrix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Feb 2016 22:22:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/02/29/donald-trump-and-zuckerbergs-matrix/</guid><description>&lt;p>Prediction markets have the Republican nomination for President of the USA going to billionaire reality TV host and megalomaniac Donald Trump. On the other side of the aisle, self-described socialist Sanders is making Hillary Clinton’s campaign sweat. This isn’t “politics as usual” for anyone except the writers of The Simpsons.

According to the party decides theory (or at least my interpretation of &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-party-decides/">Nate Silver’s interpretation&lt;/a>) the party, as a loose coalition of opinion forming individuals, can heavily weigh in on who gets nominated. Yet they took so long to settle on Rubio that Trump is now the likeliest candidate. Perhaps this is a sign of the GOP’s weakness, or perhaps they hate Cruz more than they hate Trump. These are all strong arguments that have been well &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-assume-conservatives-will-rally-behind-trump/">argued elsewhere&lt;/a>, but I would like to present an alternative one: the party just isn’t as effective at forming opinions as it used to be, because social media has created a pervasive platform for radicalisation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't fear foreign education</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2012/11/20/dont-fear-foreign-education/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2012 15:52:58 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2012/11/20/dont-fear-foreign-education/</guid><description>&lt;p>Startling new data show that emigration out of Hungary is at a 20-year record high and that many more Hungarians have seriously considered leaving Hungary to live, work, or study in another member state of the EU. But instead of speaking ominously about the potentially catastrophic consequences of such emigration trends for Hungary, it is useful to think of this increased mobility as a potentially positive phenomenon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Geographic mobility is often an indicator of social mobility. Movement allows workers and entrepreneurs to fill market gaps wherever they may be found. In fact, it is estimated that increased mobility in the EU would greatly enhance European competitiveness in comparison to the United States, where citizens have always been willing to move in search of opportunities, and China, where urbanisation has been key to economic growth. Of course, international mobility may be considered qualitatively different than national mobility. Moving from Budapest to Győr (or from California to New York) is different than moving from Hungary to Germany or England. These differences ought not to be overstated, however; we are now part of a pan-European single market (whether we like it or not), and geographic mobility has become a central characteristic of that market.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
